Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

# Udacity Project - Frogger: Arcade Game by Stafano Monteiro


**[Play Game](https://stefanomonteiro.github.io/Frogger-Arcade-Game/)**

## **Project Requirements:**


You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.




### **How to Run the Game:**

* Simply open index.html and Click on Play Game.





### **Game Objective:**

Get the player across to the swimming pool to earn points, avoid any contact with the bugs and move around the rocks that are on your way.




### **Game Info:**



#### * Crosses

For every succesful Cross 10 points will be rewarded.
However, if you have crossed more than:
50 times - each cross rewards 20 points.

100 times - each cross rewards 30 points.

150 times - each cross rewards 40 points.



#### * Gems

Gems can pop up on your way, don't ignore them. Collect as many as possible to increase your Score.
Blue Gem
Blue Gem: 100 points
Green Gem
Green Gem: 200 points
Orange Gem
Orange Gem: 400 points



#### * Streak

Don't let them bite you. Keep your crosses' Streak as high as possible to multiple the score you earn.
Streak higher than:
20 double the points you earn.

30 triples the points you earn.

50 quadruples the points you earn.



#### * Stay Alive

Besides the Gems, Hearts and Stars will also come your way. Collect them to live longer.
Heart
Once your Heart gets to 0 you cannot be bitten by a bug anymore. If so Game Over!!
Star
Star gives you a temporary invincibility. For 5 seconds Bugs won't be able to bite you and you will be able to climb over the rocks. Use it wisely. Hint: There can be too many rocks on your way!!!
